During this project, our team of five members worked on the development of a website that replicates the functionality of LinkedIn. We utilized Java, MySQL, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to implement the features. The project spanned across four sprints, and within a total duration of two months, we successfully delivered a fully functional website.

The website comprises three distinct dashboards: one for hiring, another for job seekers, and the last one for the admin panel. The admin panel provides comprehensive authority, allowing actions such as removing users, managing job postings, and editing job details in case of inappropriateness.

The entire project was completed within the planned three sprints, and we documented the process with UML class diagrams and detailed information for each sprint
